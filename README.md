# Car-Headlight-Controller-

Headlights of vehicles pose a great danger during night driving. The drivers of most vehicles use high, bright beam while driving at night. This causes a discomfort to the person travelling from the opposite direction and therefore experiences a sudden glare for a short period of time. This is caused due to the high intense headlight beam from the other vehicle coming towards the one from the opposite direction. In this project, an automatic headlight dimmer which uses a LDR sensor module has been designed to dim the headlight of oncoming vehicles to avoid human eye effects. This automatically switches the high beam into low beam, therefore reducing the glare effect by sensing the light intensity value of approaching vehicle and also eliminated the requirement of manual switching by the driver which was not done at all times.
